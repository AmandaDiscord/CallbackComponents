# Callback Components
Written by @PapiOphidian, this module is an interaction handler for ThunderStorm to easily associate message components with in code callbacks which are highly customizable.
This module is the spiritual successor to AmandaDiscord/ReactionMenu. However, this module makes use of Discord's Message Components instead of Reactions.

## Requirements
This module requires AmandaDiscord/Thunderstorm.

## Usage
There is a static method handler which accepts data which is emitted from ThunderStorm where all data is compatible.
