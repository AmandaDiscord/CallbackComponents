# InteractionMenu
Written by @PapiOphidian, this module is an interaction handler for ThunderStorm to easily create menus which are highly customizable.
This module is the spiritual successor to AmandaDiscord/ReactionMenu. However, this module makes use of Discord's Buttons instead of Reactions.

## Requirements
This module requires AmandaDiscord/Thunderstorm.

## Note
There is a static method handler which accepts data which is emitted from ThunderStorm where all data is compatible.
