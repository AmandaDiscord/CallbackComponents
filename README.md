# Callback Components
Written by @PapiOphidian, this module is an interaction handler for the raw api to easily associate message components with in code callbacks which are highly customizable.
This module is the spiritual successor to AmandaDiscord/ReactionMenu. However, this module makes use of Discord's Message Components instead of Reactions.

## Usage
There is a static method handler which accepts data which is emitted from the gateway or http request where all data is compatible.
